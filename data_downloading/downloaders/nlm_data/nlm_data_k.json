Inhalation: Exposure to dust generated during the handling or use of the product may cause temporary irritation to eyes, skin, nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract. Persons subjected to large amounts of this dust will be forced to leave area because of nuisance conditions such as coughing, sneezing and nasal irritation. Labored breathing may occur after excessive inhalation. If respiratory symptoms persist, consult physician.  Eye contact: Dust can cause temporary mechanical irritation of eyes. If burning, redness, itching, pain or other symptoms persist or develop, consult physician.  Skin: None known.  Ingestion: None known.

Alcohol may enhance the toxic effects of methylene chloride exposure. May cross the placenta. May be excreted in breast milk.Inhalation: Vapor harmful. May cause upper respiratory tract irritation and central nervous system depression with symptoms such as confusion, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, and fatigue. Mist or vapor can irritate the throat and lungs. Causes formation of carbon monoxide in blood which may affect the cardiovascular system and central nervous system. Continued exposure may cause unconsciousness and even death. Intentional misuse of this product by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the vapors can be harmful or fatal. Concurrent exposure to carbon monoxide, smoking, and physical activity may increase the level of carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood resulting in additive effects.

Effects may range from mild irritation to severe pain, and possibly burns, depending on the intensity of contact. Prolonged or repeated contact may dry the skin and cause irritation. Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, drying and cracking of the skin, and skin burns.Eye contact: This material is an eye irritant. Vapors may irritate the eyes. Contact may cause tearing, redness, a stinging or burning feeling, swelling, and blurred vision.Ingestion: Poison. May be fatal or cause blindness if swallowed. May cause nausea or vomiting. Aspiration hazard. This material may be aspirated into the lungs during vomiting. If vomiting results in aspiration, chemical pneumonia could occur. It can be readily absorbed by the stomach and intestinal tract. Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract may produce central nervous system depression and systemic effects.
