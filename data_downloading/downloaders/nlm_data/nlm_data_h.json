Remove the nozzle and then continue to depressurize by dispensing the chemicals into a waste container (a box lined with a plastic bag) that has adequate industrial liquid absorbing medium in the bottom. Dispense the residual chemicals until the pressure is down to a minimum or there are just large bubbles in the hose.4. Close the cylinder valves completely, and then operate the dispensing unit again to empty and depressurize the hoses. Use a 9/16 wrench and remove the hoses from the cylinders. Use caution in case there is some residual chemical and/or pressure in the hoses.5. Invert the cylinder and point away from face. Slowly open the cylinder over the waste container to catch any residual spray.6. Return the cylinder to an upright position. Shake the container; there should not be any sloshing of liquid.

Do not put concentrate or dilute into food or drink containers. Avoid contamination of feed, foodstuffs and domestic water supplies. Store in a cool dry place, preferably in a locked storage area. Do not store diluted spray. Store above freezing. Handle concentrate in a ventilated area. Keep container closed.

Do not contaminate water by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes.", "acute_health_effects": "From MSDS IMMEDIATE CONCERNS: - CAUSES EYE IRRITATION - HARMFUL IF SWALLOWED - DO NOT GET IN EYES, ON SKIN, OR ON CLOTHING - AVOID BREATHING VAPOR OR SPRAY MIST - KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS EYES: This substance is slightly irritating to the eyes. Eye contact may include discomfort, tearing, swelling, redness, and blurred vision. SKIN: The skin irritation potential of this substance has not been determined. However, it may be a moderate skin irritant so contact with the skin could cause prolonged (days) injury to the affected area. This may include discomfort, redness, swelling, and possibly blistering. The systemic toxicity of this substance has not been determined. However, it should be practically non-toxic to internal organs if it gets on the skin. INGESTION: The oral toxicity of this substance has not been determined. However, it may be slightly toxic to internal organs if swallowed. The degree of injury will depend on the amount absorbed from the gut. This product contains a petroleum distillate. Due to the low viscosity of petroleum distillates, they can get directly into the lungs through aspiration either during swallowing or vomiting of the product. INHALATION: The systemic toxicity of this substance has not been determined. However, it should be practically non-toxic to internal organs if inhaled. TARGET ORGANS: Chlorpyrifos is an inhibitor of the cholinesterase enzyme, found in nervous tissue, red blood cells, and plasma. COMMENTS HEALTH: Depending upon the extent and degree of overexposure to the product, signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can result following either ingestion, skin contact or inhalation routes of exposure. Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can also result from either acute (one time), subchronic (repeated short-term) and chronic (daily life-time) overexposure to the product. Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition usually occur within 12 hours following overexposure. These effects may include, but may not be limited to, headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constriction of the pupil of the eye, blurred or dark vision, excessive salivation or nasal discharge, profuse sweating and abdominal cramps. Incontinence, unconsciousness, convulsions and breathing difficulties are indicative of severe poisoning. In untreated severe poisoning, death is due to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. This product also contains a petroleum distillate. Depending upon the degree of overexposure, the systemic toxicity of the product may be of less concern than the potential clinical complications that can result from aspiration of the petroleum distillate into the lungs if the product is either swallowed or vomited.", "flammability_rating": 2, "msds_date": "2001-06-26", "chronic_health_effects": "From MSDS Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can also result from either acute (one time), subchronic (repeated short-term) and chronic (daily life-time) overexposure to the product.
