The liquid is in such small quantity that it does not normally present a health hazard. If a release of many containers of this product occurs at the same time, inhalation may cause central nervous system depression. In addition, under these circumstances an oxygen-deficient environment can occur, resulting in a hazard of asphyxiation. If the container is heated or punctured, rupture of the container may occur, and may cause injury. Frostbite can be caused by contact with rapidly expanding gases.  HEALTH EFFECTS OR RISKS FROM EXPOSURE: Over-exposure to this gas mixture may cause the following health effects. ACUTE: There are no anticipated acute effects after exposure to this product. In the event that a very large number of containers are released simultaneously, adverse effects on the central nervous system and irritation may occur and an oxygen-deficient environment may be produced.", "flammability_rating": 3, "msds_date": "2004-08-19", "chronic_health_effects": "Chronic exposure to this product may cause dermatitis to the skin."}, {"form": "aerosol", "msds_date": "2016-09-01", "handling": "Keep away from heat, spark and flame.
