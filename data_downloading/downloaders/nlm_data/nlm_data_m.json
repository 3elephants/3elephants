Exposure can occur by eye or skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation of dusts or mists. Eye contact with an unspecified amount of urea powder has caused reversible corneal opacity along with irritation as a foreign body in the eye with tearing and blinking. Skin contact with powdered urea is not expected to cause irritation. Dermal absorption is expected to be minimal (6-11 %). Ingestion is expected to cause nausea, vomiting, and possible excitement and convulsions. These high exposure levels are not considered relevant to occupational or normal use exposure situations.
