A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and burning feeling in the upper stomach region occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolors contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from ingestion are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed systemic poisoning may occur producing kidney and liver damage, wide-spread capillary damage, and be fatal; death may occur after relapse from an apparent recovery. Anemia may occur in acute poisoning. Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.EYEAlthough the material is not thought to be an irritant, direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterized by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn).SKINThe material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or skin irritation following contact (as classified using animal models).

POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS  INHALATION: This product contains crystalline silica. Prolonged exposure to respirable crystalline silica has been known to cause silicosis, a lung disease which may be disabling.  SKIN CONTACT: Handling may cause dry skin. Skin contact during hardening (rehydration) may slowly develop sufficient heat to cause severe burns possibly resulting in permanent injury. Do not allow product to harden around any body part or while in continuous, prolonged contact with the skin.  EYE CONTACT: Dust can cause mechanical eye irritation.

It is recommended that a NIOSH approved particulate respirator be worn whenever working with this product results in airborne dust exposure exceeding the prescribed limits.  Potential Health Effects  Primary Routes of Entry: Inhalation, Dermal contact  Eye Contact: Direct contact may cause mechanical irritation.  Skin Contact: Continued and prolonged contact may result in dry skin. Contact with dust or glass fibers may produce itching, rash and/or redness. Repeated or prolonged exposure may result in dermatitis.  Inhalation: Acute exposure to airborne dust concentrations in excess of the PEL/TLV may result in coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, general irritation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and impaired pulmonary function. Exposures to respirable crystalline silica have not been documented during normal use of this product.

Primary Route of Exposure: Skin  Health Effect Information EYE CONTACT: Avoid eye contact. This product may be slightly irritating to the eyes upon direct contact. Based on testing of similar products and/or components. Exposure to high concentrations of vapors may be irritating to the eyes. SKIN CONTACT: Avoid skin contact. This product may cause slight skin irritation upon direct contact. Based on testing of similar products and/or components. Prolonged or repeated contact may result in contact dermatitis which is characterized by dryness, chapping, and reddening. Pre-existing skin conditions may make the skin more susceptible and facilitate uptake by this route. May be absorbed through skin.  INHALATION: Avoid prolonged inhalation of vapors. This product may be considered a low health hazard unless inhaled in very high concentrations. Acute and chronic exposure to vapors may be irritating to the respiratory tract. Severe intoxication may lead to drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Exposure to even higher concentrations may lead to loss of consciousness and convulsions followed by death. At extremely high concentrations where oxygen displacement is a factor, asphyxiation may occur.  INGESTION: Do not ingest. Ingestion of small quantities is usually nonfatal unless aspiration occurs. Aspiration may lead to chemical pneumonitis which is characterized by pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and may be fatal. Signs of lung involvement include increased respiratory rate, increased heart rate, and a bluish discoloration of the skin. Coughing, choking, and gagging are often noted at the time of aspiration. Gastrointestinal discomfort may develop, followed by vomiting with a further risk of aspiration. Severe oral intoxication will lead to intense burning of the throat and may result in drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea.

May cause slight temporary corneal injury.Skin Contact: Prolonged contact may cause moderate skin irritation with local redness. Material may stick to skin causing irritation upon removal. May stain skin.Skin Absorption: Prolonged skin contact is unlikely to result in absorption of harmful amounts.Skin Sensitization: Skin contact may cause an allergic skin reaction. Animal studies have shown that skin contact with isocyanates may play a role in respiratory sensitization.Inhalation: In confined or poorly ventilated areas, vapor can easily accumulate and can cause unconsciousness and death due to displacement of oxygen. Excessive exposure may cause irritation to upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) and lungs. May cause pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs.) Effects may be delayed. May cause central nervous system depression. Symptoms of excessive exposure may be anesthetic or narcotic effects; dizziness and drowsiness may be observed. Excessive exposure may increase sensitivity to epinephrine and increase myocardial irritability (irregular heartbeats). Decreased lung function has been associated with overexposure to isocyanates.Respiratory Sensitization: May cause allergic respiratory response. MDI concentrations below the exposure guidelines may cause allergic respiratory reactions in individuals already sensitized. Asthma-like symptoms may include coughing, difficult breathing and a feeling of tightness in the chest.Occasionally, breathing difficulties may be life threatening.Ingestion: Low toxicity if swallowed. Small amounts swallowed incidentally as a result of normal handling operations are not likely to cause injury; however, swallowing larger amounts may cause injury.
