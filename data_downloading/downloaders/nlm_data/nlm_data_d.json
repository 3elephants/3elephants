Eye Contact: The undiluted product is moderately irritating to the eyes. Eye contact may include discomfort, tearing, swelling, redness, and blurred vision.      Skin Contact: The substance is a moderate skin irritant. Skin irritation may include discomfort, redness, swelling, and possibly blistering. If absorbed through the skin, this substance is considered practically non-toxic to internal organs.      Ingestion: Depending upon the amount of product swallowed, this substance can produce signs and symptoms of systemic poisoning.

Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can also result from either acute (one time), subchronic (repeated short-term) and chronic (daily life-time) overexposure to the product. Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition usually occur within 12 hours following overexposure.

The odor threshold for Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate is 0.17 ppm. TDI is considered to have a poor warning properties, that is if you can smell it, then it is above the recommended occupational standards for the compound. Irritation Threshold- The irritation threshold for this product has not been clearly established because those persons sensitized to TDI may show signs and symptoms of irritation at levels far below those that are not sensitized. Inhalation- Acute: Exposure may cause mucous membrane and respiratory tract irritation, tightness of chest, headache, shortness of breath, and a dry cough. Inhalation may cause headaches, drowsiness, unconsciousness, anesthesia and asthma-like symptoms to occur. These symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. A hypersensitive pneumonitis may also occur if the person is sensitized. This syndrome is characterized by fever, nonproductive cough, wheezing, chills, and shortness of breath. The effects of acute exposure may be delayed in onset up to 12-24 hours. Chronic: Repeated exposure may cause an allergic sensitization of the respiratory tract. This is characterized by an asthma-like response upon re-exposure to the chemical. The symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Repeated overexposure to isocyanates and high one-time accidental exposures to isocyanates have been associated with a gradual decrease in lung volume (lung damage). Skin- Acute: If not properly removed, liquid spills of TDI on the skin may cause irritation, redness, swelling, blistering or burns. Chronic: Repeated contact may cause irritation of the skin and an allergic skin reaction consisting of a hive-like rash on locations not even directly contacted by the liquid. Animal studies indicate that dermal exposure to TDI may induce an allergic sensitization of the respiratory tract as well. This is characterized by an asthma-like response which may include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and may be fatal. Eye- The effects of liquid directly contacting the eye can be significant. This may result in severe irritation and possible damage to the cornea and impairment of vision. The effects of high vapor concentrations may vary from slight irritation with tearing and burning sensation to keratitis consisting of inflammation of the cornea and impairment of vision. Ingestion- Acute: Can result in irritation of the mouth, stomach tissue and digestive tract. Gastroenteritis may result with any or all of the following symptoms; nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache. Small amounts aspirated into the lungs during ingestion or vomiting may cause mild to severe pulmonary injury and possibly death. Chronic: More pronounced gastroenteritis effects would probably occur if this material was repeatedly ingested. Target organ toxicity- Irritation to the skin, eyes, mucous membrane, and respiratory tract. Reproductive and developmental toxicity- TDI is not known or reported to be a developmental or reproductive toxin.

Vapors are heavier than air and may travel a long distance and accumulate in low lying areas. Ignition and/or flash back may occur. Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate container. Use of non-sparking or explosion- proof equipment may be necessary, depending upon the type of operation. Containers, even those that have been emptied, can contain vapors. Do not cut, drill, grind, weld, or perform similar operations in or near empty containers. Do not enter confined spaces unless adequately ventilated. Spills of these organic materials on hot fibrous insulations may lead to lowering of the autoignition temperatures possibly resulting in spontaneous combustion. Store in a dry place. Avoid prolonged exposure to heat and air. Protect from atmospheric moisture. Blowing agent may migrate from product and accumulate in some storage situations. Elevated temperatures can cause pressure buildup in closed containers due to the release of blowing agents. Store in the following material(s): Carbon steel. Stainless steel. Polypropylene. Polyethylene-lined container. Teflon. Glass-lined container. Aluminum. Plasite 3066 lined container. Plasite 3070 lined container. 316 stainless steel.

Contains gas under pressure; may explode if heated. Causes skin and eye irritation. May cause an allergic skin reaction. Harmful if inhaled. May cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled. May cause respiratory irritation. May cause damage to organs (Respiratory Tract) through prolonged or repeated exposure if inhaled.  Potential Health Effects  Eye Contact: May cause moderate eye irritation. May cause slight temporary corneal injury.  Skin Contact: Prolonged skin contact is unlikely to result in absorption of harmful amounts. May stain skin.  Inhalation: At room temperature, vapors are minimal due to low volatility. However, certain operations may generate vapor or mist concentrations sufficient to cause respiratory irritation and other adverse effects. Such operations include those in which the material is heated, sprayed or otherwise mechanically dispersed such as drumming, venting or pumping. Excessive exposure may cause irritation to upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) and lungs. May cause pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs.) Effects may be delayed. Decreased lung function has been associated with overexposure to isocyanates.  Ingestion: Low toxicity if swallowed. Small amounts swallowed incidentally as a result of normal handling operations are not likely to cause injury; however, swallowing larger amounts may cause injury.", "carcinogenicity": "Lung tumors have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to respirable aerosol droplets of MDI/Polymeric MDI (6 mg/m3) for their lifetime.

The components of this glass product listed below are from the inventory of potentially hazardous substances referenced by FED/OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.1200. Other Information Frits are produced from the chemical reactions which occur during the high temperature smelting of various raw materials to form a molten glass. This glass is rapidly cooled and then ground to produce powdered frit. The lead listed for this product is incorporated into the glass structure of the frit, chemically reacted in the form of silicates of other essentially insoluble complexes. Exposure to the hazardous ingredients can occur if spray mist is inhaled or glaze ingested and the ingredient dissolves out of the glass. Because of the chemical stability of frit and its resistance to attack by acids or alkali, this is anticipated to occur very slowly. This product contains the following component(s) that require reporting under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, also known as Title III of SARA (Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act), and 40 CFR Part 372: TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION Primary Routes of exposure: Inhalation, Skin Contact, and Ingestion Overexposure Effects Overexposure to cadmium by inhalation can result in a metallic taste in the mouth, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness, leg pains and fluid in the lungs. These signs and symptoms may be delayed, sometimes occurring four to eight hours following exposure. Kidney and liver damage may also occur. Swallowing can result in severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, salivation, headache, muscle cramps and dizziness. Excessive ingestion of barium containing frit may cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, muscular paralysis, slow pulse rate, irregular heart contractions, and low blood potassium levels. Metal fumes from firing may cause lung inflammation and injury in terms of hours with symptoms of chest pains, chills, cough, headache, and diarrhea.
