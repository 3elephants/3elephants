Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.  Potential Health Effects  Eye Contact: This material is an eye irritant. May cause transient mild eye irritation with short-term contact with liquid sprays or mists. Symptoms include stinging, watering, redness, and swelling.  Skin Contact: May cause mild transient skin irritation. Symptoms may include redness, itching, and burning of the skin. Repeated or prolonged skin contact can produce moderate irritation (dermatitis). The severity of irritation will depend on the amount of material that is applied to the skin and the speed and thoroughness that it is removed. Data for cobalt metal powder has shown the potential to cause allergic contact dermatitis if there is prior sensitization. Most rashes associated with cobalt occur on the hands and appear within the first year of occupational exposure to cobalt.  Inhalation: May cause central nervous system depression with symptoms including dizziness, headache, nausea, fatigue, drowsiness, or unconsciousness. Severe overexposure may cause convulsions; unconsciousness; and death. Intentional misuse of this product by deliberately concentrating and inhaling can be harmful or fatal. Cobalt metal powder is a known allergen that produces characteristic symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, dry cough, and labored breathing. Usually the asthma symptoms appear 4-6 hours after exposure and often Manganese compounds can cause central nervous system (CNS) damage by inhalation of fumes and dust. CNS effects may include drowsiness and perioral numbness. Respiratory effects may include \"metal fume fever\" and pleuritis. Chronic exposure may cause Parkinson-like symptoms (such as muscle weakness, tremor, slurred speech, and gait disturbances). May cause psychiatric symptoms such as nervousness and irritability.  Ingestion: Harmful or fatal if swallowed. If swallowed, this material may irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. It can readily be absorbed by the stomach and intestinal tract. Symptoms include a burning sensation of the mouth and esophagus, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, staggering gait, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, and delirium, as well as additional central nervous system (CNS) effects. Due to its light viscosity, there is the danger of aspiration into the lungs during vomiting, which can result in severe lung damage or death.", "flammability_rating": 2, "msds_date": "2015-04-20", "chronic_health_effects": "From SDS:  Reports have associated repeated and prolonged overexposure to solvents with irreversible brain and nervous system damage.

Material should be kept dry, and protected from the elements.Personal Protective Equipment: Personal Protective Equipment: Eyes/FaceSafety glasses with side shields are recommended to keep dust out of the eyes.Personal Protective Equipment: SkinLeather or cotton gloves should be worn to prevent skin contact and irritation. Barrier creams may also be used to reduce skin contact and irritation caused by fiber glass.Personal Protective Equipment: RespiratoryA respirator should be used if ventilation is unavailable, or is inadequate for keeping dust and fiber levels below the applicable exposure limits. In those cases, use a NIOSH-certified disposable or reusable particulate respirator with an efficiency rating of N95 or higher (under 42 CFR 84) when working with this product. For exposures up to five times the established exposure  limits use a quarter-mask respirator, rated N95 or higher; and for exposures up to ten times the established exposure limits use a half-mask respirator (e.g., MSA's DM-11, Racal's Delta N95, 3M's 8210), rated N95 or higher. Operations such as sawing, blowing, tear out, and spraying may generate airborne fiber concentrations requiring a higher level of respiratory protection. For exposures up to 50 times the established exposure limits use a full-face respirator, rated N99 or higher.Personal Protective Equipment: GeneralWear a cap, a loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirt and long pants to protect skin from irritation. Exposed skin areas should be washed with soap and warm water after handling or working with fiber glass. Clothing should be washed separately from other clothes, and the washer should be rinsed thoroughly (run empty for a complete wash cycle). This will reduce the chances offiber glass being transferred to other clothing.", "acute_health_effects": "From MSDS Summary Breathing dust from this product may cause a scratchy throat, congestion, and slight coughing.

May be fatal or cause blindness if swallowed. Eye and skin irritant. Vapor Harmful. Use only with adequate ventilation to prevent buildup of vapors.Potential Health EffectsInhalation: Vapor harmful. May cause upper respiratory tract irritation and central nervous system depression with symptoms such as confusion, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, and fatigue. Mist or vapor can irritate the throat and lungs. Causes formation of carbon monoxide in blood which may affect the cardiovascular system and central nervous system. Continued exposure may cause unconsciousness and even death. Intentional misuse of this product by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the vapors can be harmful or fatal. Concurrent exposure to carbon monoxide, smoking, and physical activity may increase the level of carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood resulting in additive effects. This product is a simple asphyxiant.Skin contact: This product is a skin irritant. Product may be absorbed through the skin. Harmful if absorbed through the skin. Effects may range from mild irritation to severe pain, and possibly burns, depending on the intensity of contact. Prolonged or repeated contact may dry the skin and cause irritation. Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, drying and cracking of the skin, and skin burns.Eye contact: This material is an eye irritant. Vapors may irritate the eyes. Contact may cause tearing, redness, a stinging or burning feeling, swelling, and blurred vision.Ingestion: Poison. May be fatal or cause blindness if swallowed. May cause nausea or vomiting. Aspiration hazard. This material may be aspirated into the lungs during vomiting. If vomiting results in aspiration, chemical pneumonia could occur. It can be readily absorbed by the stomach and intestinal tract. Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract may produce central nervous system depression and systemic effects. Swallowing thismaterial may irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. May cause cyanosis (blue coloring of the skin and nails from lack of oxygen).Medical Conditions Generally Aggravated By Exposure: Heart of cardiovascular disorders, kidney disorders, liver disorders, central nervous system disorders, respiratory system (including asthma and other breathing disorders), skin disorders and allergies.
