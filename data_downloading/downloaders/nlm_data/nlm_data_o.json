Do not spray on a naked flame or any incandescent material. Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Use the mixture in premises free of naked flames or other sources of ignition and ensure that electrical equipment is suitably protected. Keep packages tightly closed and away from sources of heat, sparks and naked flames. Do not use tools which may produce sparks. Do not smoke. Prevent access by unauthorised personnel. Observe precautions stated on label and also industrial safety regulations. Do not breathe in aerosols. Avoid inhaling vapors. Also provide breathing apparatus for certain short tasks of an exceptional nature and for emergency interventions. In all cases, recover emissions at source.

May have reversible effects on the eyes, such as eye irritation which is totally reversible by the end of observation at 21 days.  Skin Contact: Repeated or prolonged contact with the mixture may cause removal of natural oil from the skin resulting in non-allergic contact dermatitis and absorption through the skin.  Inhalation: Exposure to vapours from solvents in the mixture in excess of the stated occupational exposure limit may result in adverse health effects such as mucous membrane and respiratory system irritation and adverse effects on kidney, liver and central nervous system. Symptoms produced will include headaches, numbness, dizziness, fatigue, muscular asthenia and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness.

Eye contact may include discomfort, tearing, swelling redness, and blurred vision. SKIN: This product causes skin irritation. This product is harmful to internal organs if absorbed through the skin. The degree of injury will depend on the duration of exposure and amount absorbed. INGESTION: This substance is slightly toxic to internal organs if swallowed. This product contains a petroleum distillate. Because of the low viscosity of the petroleum distillate, it can directly enter or be aspirated into the lungs either during swallowing or vomiting the substance. Once in the lungs, the substance is very difficult to remove and can cause severe injury to the lungs and death. INHALATION: This substance is harmful to internal organs if inhaled. The degree of injury will depend on the airborne concentration and duration of exposure. This substance may be irritating if inhaled. COMMENTS HEALTH: This product contains esfenvalerate, a cyano-pyrethroid that has the potential to cause temporary dermal paresthesis, e.g. burning, tingling, stinging sensations, that may occur following overexposure. However, using spray dilutions as indicated on the product label, it is unlikely that skin exposure to the spray mist will deliver sufficient concentrations of the active ingredient to trigger the dermal symptoms.", "flammability_rating": 0, "msds_date": "2001-08-08", "chronic_health_effects": "From MSDS No information provided."}, {"reactivity_rating": 0, "manufacturer": "Ortho Group, The", "health_rating": 1, "product_category": "Landscape/Yard \u00bb outdoor \u00bb Insecticide Pesticides \u00bb lawn/turf \u00bb Insecticide", "carcinogenicity": "IARC: No NTP: No OSHA: No CARCINOGENICITY COMMENTS: The EPA has classified bifenthrin as Group C - Possible Human Carcinogen.", "disposal": "Call local solid waste agency or 1-800-CLEANUP for disposal instructions.

POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS EYES: This substance is a severe eye irritant and could cause permanent damage to your eyes and blindness. The degree of the injury will depend on the amount of material that gets into the eye and the speed and thoroughness of the first aid treatment. Symptoms of overexposure may include discomfort, irritation and redness, and blurred vision.SKIN: The undiluted product is considered a moderate skin irritant, therefore contact with the skin can cause prolonged (days) injury to the affected area. The degree of injury will depend on the amount of material that gets on the skin and the speed and thoroughness of the first aid treatment. Skin irritation may include redness, itching and swelling. This substance is considered slightly toxic to internal organs if absorbed through the skin. INGESTION: This substance is slightly toxic to internal organs if swallowed. This product contains a petroleum distillate. Because of the low viscosity of the petroleum distillate, it can directly enter or be aspirated into the lungs either during swallowing or vomiting the substance. Once in the lungs, the substance is very difficult to remove and can cause severe injury to the lungs and death.

Can cause uncontrollable release of material and irritating or toxic decomposition products. Product is essentially non-irritating to skin in most people. Contact with this uncured (wet or sticky) product may cause irritation to skin, eyes, mucous membranes and respiratory system.  Harmful if swallowed or inhaled. May cause dizziness, incoordination, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Individuals with preexisting sensitization to isocyanates may experience breathlessness, severe coughing, wheezing, chest discomfort, nose and throat irritation, reduced lung function and aggravation of pre-existing asthma or other lung conditions. Potential Health Effects Inhalation: Inhalation of vapors or mists of the product may be irritating to the respiratory system. May cause dizziness, incoordination, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Repeated exposure may lead to respiratory sensitization, producing an asthma-like condition. Inhaling extremely high concentrations of blowing agent may cause lightheadedness, headache, giddiness, shortness of breath, and may lead to narcosis, cardiac irregularities, unconsciousness and even death. Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop. Skin Contact: Product is essentially non-irritating to skin in most individuals. Product adheres to skin like an adhesive and is difficult to remove when cured. Avoid severe scrubbing, scraping or peeling off material that can irritate or damage skin. Direct contact with uncured product can cause localized irritation and discoloration of skin in some individuals. Repeated or prolonged skin contact with uncured product may cause reddening, swelling, or blistering or an allergic reaction (sensitization) in some individuals. Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop. Eye Contact: This product may cause irritation to the eyes. Direct contact in eyes with cured product may result in mechanical abrasion to cornea or physical damage to eyes. Direct contact in eyes with uncured product may cause tissue damage due to the adhesive properties of this product. Seek medical attention immediately. Ingestion: This product may be harmful if it is swallowed. Uncured product may produce corrosive damage to the gastrointestinal tract if it is swallowed. May obstruct free passage of food in gastrointestinal tract and air in the respiratory tract. Cured foam is not considered toxic.

Skin Contact: The undiluted product is considered a moderate skin irritant, therefore contact with the skin can cause prolonged (days) injury to the affected area.

Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition usually occur within 12 hours following overexposure. These effects may include, but may not be limited to, headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constriction of the pupil of the eye, blurred or dark vision, excessive salivation or nasal discharge, profuse sweating and abdominal cramps.

The degree of the injury will depend on the amount of material that gets into the eye and the speed and thoroughness of the first aid treatment. SKIN: This substance is a severe skin irritant/corrosive so contact with the skin could cause prolonged (weeks) injury to the affected area.

INGESTION: Symptoms of H2S toxicity may include headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, amnesia, tremors, depressed respiration, convulsions, cyanosis and death due to respiratory paralysis. Severe irritation of the digestive tract may also occur. INHALATION: Overexposure to hydrogen sulfide include respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, coughing, a sensation of dryness and pain in the nose, throat and chest, confusion and unconsciousness.

Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can result from either acute (one time), subchronic (repeated short-term) and chronic (daily life-time) overexposure to the product. Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition usually occur within 12 hours following overexposure. These effects may include, but may not be limited to, headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constriction of the pupil of the eye, blurred or dark vision, excessive salivation or nasal discharge, profuse sweating and abdominal cramps. Incontinence, unconsciousness, convulsions and breathing difficulties are indicative of severe poisoning.
