Systemic & Other Effects: May cause CNS disturbances. There have been a handful of isolated cases of adverse systemic effects associated with excessive expose to DEET. Most of these cases have involved long-term high dosage use of DEET on children. Acute Inhalation: Vapors and mist may irritate the nose and throat. Inhalation of higher concentrations may cause headaches, nausea, coma and other central nervous system effects including death. Eye Contact: Causes moderate eye irritation. Liquid and mist can severely irritate or damage the eyes and cause corneal burns. Skin Contact: May cause skin irritation in rare cases. Do not apply over cuts, wounds or irritated skin. Ingestion: Harmful if swallowed. Swallowing large amounts causes headaches, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea and perhaps unconsciousness. Ingestion of ethyl alcohol may be fatal. Small amounts aspirated into respiratory system during ingestion or vomiting may cause mild to severe pulmonary injury possibly progressing to death.

This material is toxic to aquatic organisms and should be kept out of sewage and drainage systems and all bodies of water.", "acute_health_effects": "From MSDS POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS EYES: Causes irreversible eye damage. Symptoms may include pain, tearing, swelling, redness and blurred vision. SKIN: This substance is a skin irritant so contact with the skin could cause prolonged (weeks) injury to the affected area. The degree of injury will depend on the amount of material that gets on the skin and the speed and thoroughness of the first aid treatment. Symptoms may include pain or a feeling of heat, discoloration, swelling and blistering. The dermal toxicity of this substance has not been determined. However, it may be slightly toxic to internal organs if absorbed through the skin. The degree of injury will depend on the amount absorbed. INGESTION: This substance is slightly toxic to internal organs if swallowed. INHALATION : If inhaled, this substance is considered practically non-toxic to internal organs. This substance may be irritating if inhaled. Respiratory tract irritation may include, but may not be limited to, one or more of the following: nasal discharge, sore throat, coughing, bronchitis and difficulty in breathing. COMMENTS HEALTH: Depending upon the extent and degree of overexposure to the product, signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can result following either ingestion, skin contact or inhalation routes of exposure. Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can result from either acute (one time), subchronic (repeated short-term) and chronic (daily life-time) overexposure to the product.
