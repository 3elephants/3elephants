May cause respiratory irritation.  Potential Health Effects  Eye Contact: Causes serious eye damage. Symptoms may include discomfort or pain, excess blinking and tear production, with marked redness and swelling of the conjunctiva.  Skin contact: The Portland cement in this product can cause serious, potentially irreversible damage to skin, eye, respiratory and digestive tracts due to chemical (caustic) burns, including third degree burns. Burns from Portland cement may not cause immediate pain or discomfort. You cannot rely on pain to alert you to cement burns. Therefore precautions must be taken to prevent all contact with Portland cement. Cement burns can become worse even after contact has ended. If there is contact with this product, immediately remove all product from body and thoroughly rinse with water. If you experience or suspect a cement burn or inflammation you should immediately see a health care professional. Skin burns and irritation may be caused by brief exposure, though often are caused by extended exposure of 15 minutes, an hour, or longer. Interaction of Portland cement with water or sweat releases a caustic solution which produces the burns or irritation. Any extended exposure should be treated as though a burn has occurred until determined otherwise. Skin contact with Portland cement can also cause inflammation of the skin, referred to as dermatitis. Signs and symptoms of dermatitis can include itching, redness, swelling, blisters, scaling, and other changes in the normal condition of the skin. Signs and symptoms of burns include the above and whitening, yellowing, blackening, peeling or cracking of skin. The Portland cement in this product may cause allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals. This overreaction of the immune system can lead to severe inflammation. Sensitization may result from a single exposure to the low levels of Cr(VI) in Portland cement or repeated exposures over months or years. Sensitization is long lasting and, after sensitization, even very small quantities can trigger the dermatitis. Sensitization is uncommon.

Symptoms may include discomfort or pain, excess blinking and tear production, with marked redness and swelling of the conjunctiva.  Skin contact: The Portland cement in this product can cause serious, potentially irreversible damage to skin, eye, respiratory and digestive tracts due to chemical (caustic) burns, including third degree burns. Burns from Portland cement may not cause immediate pain or discomfort. You cannot rely on pain to alert you to cement burns.

May cause cancer through chronic inhalation. Causes severe skin burns and serious eye damage. May cause an allergic skin reaction.Causes damage to lungs through prolonged or repeated inhalation. May cause respiratory irritation.  Potential Health Effects  Eye Contact: Causes serious eye damage. Symptoms may include discomfort or pain, excess blinking and tear production, with marked redness and swelling of the conjunctiva.  Skin contact: The Portland cement in this product can cause serious, potentially irreversible damage to skin, eye, respiratory and digestive tracts due to chemical (caustic) burns, including third degree burns. Burns from Portland cement may not cause immediate pain or discomfort. You cannot rely on pain to alert you to cement burns. Therefore precautions must be taken to prevent all contact with Portland cement. Cement burns can become worse even after contact has ended. If there is contact with this product, immediately remove all product from body and thoroughly rinse with water. If you experience or suspect a cement burn or inflammation you should immediately see a health care professional. Skin burns and irritation may be caused by brief exposure, though often are caused by extended exposure of 15 minutes, an hour, or longer. Interaction of Portland cement with water or sweat releases a caustic solution which produces the burns or irritation. Any extended exposure should be treated as though a burn has occurred until determined otherwise. Skin contact with Portland cement can also cause inflammation of the skin, referred to as dermatitis. Signs and symptoms of dermatitis can include itching, redness, swelling, blisters, scaling, and other changes in the normal condition of the skin. Signs and symptoms of burns include the above and whitening, yellowing, blackening, peeling or cracking of skin. The Portland cement in this product may cause allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals. This overreaction of the immune system can lead to severe inflammation. Sensitization may result from a single exposure to the low levels of Cr(VI) in Portland cement or repeated exposures over months or years. Sensitization is long lasting and, after sensitization, even very small quantities can trigger the dermatitis. Sensitization is uncommon.

May cause cancer through chronic inhalation. Causes severe skin burns and serious eye damage. May cause an allergic skin reaction.Causes damage to lungs through prolonged or repeated inhalation. May cause respiratory irritation.  Potential Health Effects  Eye Contact: Causes serious eye damage. Symptoms may include discomfort or pain, excess blinking and tear production, with marked redness and swelling of the conjunctiva.  Skin contact: The Portland cement in this product can cause serious, potentially irreversible damage to skin, eye, respiratory and digestive tracts due to chemical (caustic) burns, including third degree burns. Burns from Portland cement may not cause immediate pain or discomfort. You cannot rely on pain to alert you to cement burns. Therefore precautions must be taken to prevent all contact with Portland cement. Cement burns can become worse even after contact has ended. If there is contact with this product, immediately remove all product from body and thoroughly rinse with water. If you experience or suspect a cement burn or inflammation you should immediately see a health care professional. Skin burns and irritation may be caused by brief exposure, though often are caused by extended exposure of 15 minutes, an hour, or longer. Interaction of Portland cement with water or sweat releases a caustic solution which produces the burns or irritation. Any extended exposure should be treated as though a burn has occurred until determined otherwise. Skin contact with Portland cement can also cause inflammation of the skin, referred to as dermatitis. Signs and symptoms of dermatitis can include itching, redness, swelling, blisters, scaling, and other changes in the normal condition of the skin. Signs and symptoms of burns include the above and whitening, yellowing, blackening, peeling or cracking of skin. The Portland cement in this product may cause allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals. This overreaction of the immune system can lead to severe inflammation. Sensitization may result from a single exposure to the low levels of Cr(VI) in Portland cement or repeated exposures over months or years. Sensitization is long lasting and, after sensitization, even very small quantities can trigger the dermatitis. Sensitization is uncommon.

It does not cause burns or severe skin or eye irritation. A single exposure will not result in serious adverse health effects. Crystalline silica (quartz) is not known to be an environmental hazard. Crystalline silica (quartz) is incompatible with hydrofluoric acid, fluorine, chlorine trifluoride or oxygen difluoride.  Potential Health Effects  Route(s) of Entry: Inhalation, Skin, Ingestion  Inhalation: Silicosis Respirable crystalline silica (quartz) can cause silicosis, a fibrosis (scarring) of the lungs. Silicosis may be progressive; it may lead to disability and death. Lung Cancer Crystalline silica (quartz) inhaled from occupational sources is classified as  carcinogenic to humans. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show excess numbers of cases of scleroderma, connective tissue disorders, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney diseases and end-stage kidney disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica. Some studies show an increased incidence in chronic bronchitis and emphysema in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.  Eye contact: Crystalline silica (quartz) may cause abrasion of the cornea.  Skin contact: Not applicable.  Ingestion: Not applicable.

It does not cause burns or severe skin or eye irritation. A single exposure will not result in serious adverse health effects. Crystalline silica (quartz) is not known to be an environmental hazard. Crystalline silica (quartz) is incompatible with hydrofluoric acid, fluorine, chlorine trifluoride or oxygen difluoride.  Potential Health Effects  Route(s) of Entry: Inhalation, Skin, Ingestion  Inhalation: Silicosis Respirable crystalline silica (quartz) can cause silicosis, a fibrosis (scarring) of the lungs. Silicosis may be progressive; it may lead to disability and death. Lung Cancer Crystalline silica (quartz) inhaled from occupational sources is classified as  carcinogenic to humans. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show excess numbers of cases of scleroderma, connective tissue disorders, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney diseases and end-stage kidney disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica. Some studies show an increased incidence in chronic bronchitis and emphysema in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.  Eye contact: Crystalline silica (quartz) may cause abrasion of the cornea.  Skin contact: Not applicable.  Ingestion: Not applicable.
