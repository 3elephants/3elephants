May cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment.Potential Health EffectsEye contact: Not expected to cause prolonged or significant eye irritation.Skin contact : Contact with the skin causes irritation. Skin contact may cause drying or defatting of the skin. Contact with the skin is not expected to cause an allergic skin response. Symptoms may include pain, itching, discoloration, swelling, and blistering. Not expected to be harmful to internal organs if absorbed through the skin. High-Pressure Equipment Information: Accidental high-velocity injection under the skin of materials of this type may result in serious injury. Seek medical attention at once should an accident like this occur. The initial wound at the injection site may not appear to be serious at first; but, if left untreated, could result in disfigurement or amputation of the affected part.Ingestion: Because of its low viscosity, this material can directly enter the lungs, if swallowed, or if subsequently vomited. Once in the lungs it is very difficult to remove and can cause severe injury or death. May be irritating to mouth, throat, and stomach. Symptoms may include pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.Inhalation: The vapor or fumes from this material may cause respiratory irritation. Symptoms of respiratory irritation may include coughing and difficulty breathing. Excessive or prolonged breathing of this material may cause central nervous system effects. Central nervous system effects may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, loss of coordination, blurred vision, drowsiness, confusion, or disorientation.

Based on testing of similar products and/or components. Exposure to high concentrations of vapors may be irritating to the eyes. SKIN CONTACT: Avoid skin contact. This product may cause slight skin irritation upon direct contact. Based on testing of similar products and/or components.

INHALATION: Avoid prolonged inhalation of vapors. This product may be considered a low health hazard unless inhaled in very high concentrations. Acute and chronic exposure to vapors may be irritating to the respiratory tract. Severe intoxication may lead to drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea.

Aspiration may lead to chemical pneumonitis which is characterized by pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and may be fatal. Signs of lung involvement include increased respiratory rate, increased heart rate, and a bluish discoloration of the skin. Coughing, choking, and gagging are often noted at the time of aspiration. Gastrointestinal discomfort may develop, followed by vomiting with a further risk of aspiration. Severe oral intoxication will lead to intense burning of the throat and may result in drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea.
