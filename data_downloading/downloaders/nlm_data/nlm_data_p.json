Inhalation: Avoid prolonged inhalation of vapors. Acute and chronic exposure to vapors may be irritating to the respiratory tract. Inhalation of high concentrations of this product can cause central nervous system depression and narcosis. Severe intoxication may lead to drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Exposure to even higher concentrations may lead to loss of consciousness and convulsions followed by death. At extremely high concentrations where oxygen displacement is a factor, asphyxiation may occur. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and inhaling this product can be harmful or fatal. Ingestion: Do not ingest. Ingestion of small quantities is usually nonfatal unless aspiration occurs. Aspiration may lead to chemical pneumonitis which is characterized by pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and may be fatal. Signs of lung involvement include increased respiratory rate, increased heart rate, and a bluish discoloration of the skin. Coughing, choking, and gagging are often noted at the time of aspiration. Gastrointestinal discomfort may develop, followed by vomiting with a further risk of aspiration. Severe oral intoxication will lead to intense burning of the throat and may result in drowsiness, dullness, numbness, and headache followed by dizziness, weakness, and nausea.

Use piping and equipment adequately designed to withstand pressures to be encountered. Use with adequate ventilation. Close valve when not in use and when cylinder is empty. Always use a suitable hand truck or similar device for moving gas cylinders. Firmly secure cylinders during transport. Do not lift or move a cylinder by the cap. Do not roll or drag a cylinder to move it or allow cylinders to strike each other or any surface violently. Never tamper with or attempt to repair or alter cylinders, valves or any safety relief devices. Do not attempt to remove a stuck cap by using a lever in the cap ports. This may accidentally open the valve when the cap turns. Never work on a pressurized system.

Do not allow the temperature where cylinders are stored to exceed 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Store cylinders at least 20 feet away from highly combustible materials, and away from any sparks, flames, or any other source of heat or ignition. Protect cylinders from physical damage. Assigned storage places should be located where cylinders will not be knocked over or damaged by passing or falling objects. Segregate full and empty cylinders.
