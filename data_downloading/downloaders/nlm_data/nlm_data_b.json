Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality (death) rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern. Ingestion of finely divided carbon may produce gagging and constipation. Aspiration does not appear to be a concern as the material is generally regarded as inert and is often used as a food additive. Ingestion may produce a black stool.EYEThere is some evidence to suggest that this material can cause eye irritation and damage in some persons. Eyes exposed to carbon particulates may be liable to irritation and burning. These can remain in the eye causing inflammation lasting weeks, and can cause permanent dark dotty discoloration.SKINThe material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or skin irritation following contact (as classified using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting. Entry into the blood-stream, through, for example, cuts, abrasions or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.INHALEDThere is some evidence to suggest that this material, if inhaled, can irritate the throat and lungs of some persons. Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual. Impurities found in carbons can be toxic, including iodine.

ROUTES OF ENTRY: Inhalation, Skin contact, Eye contact  ACUTE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE Exposure during the labeled use of this product is expected to be minimal. Consumers should refer to the packaging label for proper handling procedures. However, sufficient exposure to disulfoton, the active ingredient in this product, may result in systemic intoxication due to inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase. The sequence of development of systemic effects varies with the route of entry, and the onset of symptoms may be delayed up to 12 hours. First symptoms of poisoning may be nausea, increased salivation, lacrimation, blurred vision and constricted pupils. Other symptoms of systemic poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, dizziness and sweating. After inhalation, respiratory symptoms like tightness of chest, wheezing, and laryngeal spasms, may be pronounced at first. If the poisoning is severe, then symptoms of convulsions, low blood pressure, cardiac irregularities, loss of reflexes and coma may occur. In extreme cases, death may occur due to a combination of factors such as respiratory arrest, paralysis of respiratory muscles or intense bronchoconstrictions. Complete symptomatic recovery from sublethal poisoning usually occurs within one week once the source of exposure is completely removed. The fertilizer contained in this product may cause eye, skin or mucous membrane irritation. Ingestion may cause nausea. In addition, sufficient exposure to cyfluthrin may produce paresthesia (a tingling or burning sensation on the surface of the skin). This is a frequently reported symptom associated with sufficient dermal exposure to alpha-cyano (or Type II) synthetic pyrethroids and normally subsided without treatment within 24 hours. The onset of these symptoms usually occurs 2-12 hours after exposure. Mucous membrane irritation involving the nose, throat and upper respiratory tract may occur from inhalation of aerosols containing cyfluthrin. The primary component of this product, ammonium sulfate, can be irritating to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.  MEDICAL CONDITIONS AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE: No specific medical conditions are known which may be aggravated by exposure to the active ingredient in this product.

Single dose oral toxicity is moderate; however, ingestion of larger amounts may cause serious injury. Inhalation of excessive amounts may cause upper respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, incoordination, drowsiness and unconsciousness.

Pre-existing skin, eye, liver, kidney, nervous system or respiratory disorders may be aggravated by excessive overexposure. Skin irritation may be aggravated in persons with existing skin lesions.

Pre-existing skin, eye, liver, kidney, nervous system or respiratory disorders may be aggravated by excessive overexposure. Skin irritation may be aggravated in persons with existing skin lesions.
