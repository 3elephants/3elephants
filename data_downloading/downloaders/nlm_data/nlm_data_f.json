Ingestion of small quantities is usually nonfatal unless aspiration occurs. Aspiration may lead to chemical pneumonitis which is characterized by pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and may be fatal. Signs of lung involvement include increased respiratory rate, increased heart rate, and a bluish discoloration of the skin. Coughing, choking, and gagging are often noted at the time of aspiration. Gastrointestinal discomfort may develop, followed by vomiting with a further risk of aspiration.
